This repo contains the source code for the `keyholder` npm module, and the itsy-bitsy Node API that powers it.

[Keyholder](https://keyholder.dev) provides a set of tools that make it easy to protect your API routes without needing to spend heaps of time setting up those protections. Create a project, generate API keys, and authenticate them in just a few lines of code.

## Packages
