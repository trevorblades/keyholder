# Keyholder

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/trevorblades/keyholder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/trevorblades/keyholder)

This repo contains the source code for the `keyholder` npm module, and our itsy-bitsy Node API.

[Keyholder](https://keyholder.dev) provides a set of tools that make it easy to protect your API routes without dedicating barely any time to setting up those protections. Create a project, generate API keys, and authenticate them in one line* of code.

Read more about using Keyholder [here](https://keyholder.dev).
